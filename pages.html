            <h3>The Rosetta Stone</h3>
            <p>The Rosetta Stone is one of the most famous artefacts in the world. Discovered in 1799, it provided the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. The stone is inscribed with a decree issued in Memphis in 196 BC by King Ptolemy V. The decree is inscribed in three scripts: the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the middle portion is Demotic script, and the lowest is Ancient Greek. The parallel texts made it possible to unlock the mystery of hieroglyphic writing.</p>
